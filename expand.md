2. They are custom HTML attributes that start with data-. They help with storing extra info directly on our elements without changing the rendering of our page. The implications are that the attributes aren't standardized for semantic content like mircodata. If you use structured data, then it is better to use microdata attributes.
3. DOM fragments are a container used for hold other DOM nodes, which is powerful for building a large set of elements and inserting them all at once and avoid re-renders.
4. Virtual DOM is an abstrct of the real DOM. Instead of updating the browser DOM directly, changes are made to a virtual representation. The framework will then calculate the minimal set of changes and updates the real DOM way more efficiently. We gain better performance, but lose out of memory
5. class is a keyword in js because of its use in OOP. To avoid conflicts, DOM elements use className instead of class to ensure compatibility with the js syntax.
6. eventlistener advantage is that it allows multiple event listeners on the same element and event type, but it is a bit more verbose than using direct assignment. Onclick  is simple to use byt it can only handle on event handler at a time.
